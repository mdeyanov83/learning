#4 - Making a New Flutter Project
    flutter create coffee_card

#5 - Quick Project Overview
    lib/ - All the application source code
    pubspec.yaml - project configuration file
    analysis_options.yaml - analyzer configuration file

#6 - Widgets
    Almost everything in Flutter is a Widget. Widgets are basically classes
    MyApp() - root widget (or whatever is passed to the runApp() function)
    build() - function in MyApp must return a widget or a widget tree

#7 - MaterialApp & Scaffold
    MaterialApp() - a convenience widget that sets up many of the things you typically
        need when building an app that follows Material Design guidelines
    CuperitnoApp() - used to build iOS-style applications following Apple’s Cupertino
        design guidelines

    * Text widgets must be wrapped in a Material ancestor widget to be styled correctly
        ex. Scaffold()
    Scaffold() - provides a base layout for the application, appBar at the top with a title, body, etc.

#8 - Stateless Widgets
    A widget that does not have any mutable (changeable) state. once it’s built, it can’t change
        its appearance or data unless its parent widget rebuilds it with new information.

    * Insert boilerplate code with 'stl':
        class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
            const MyWidget({super.key});

            @override
            Widget build(BuildContext context) {
                return const Placeholder();
            }
        }
