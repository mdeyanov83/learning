🗺️ 7. Navigation
    Navigator() is a Flutter widget and class that manages a stack of routes (screens). It lets you navigate
    between pages, push new screens, and pop back to previous ones — like a web browser’s history.
    * Stack-based navigation:
        - Each screen is a route.
        - You can push (go forward) or pop (go back).

    Navigator.push(
        context,
        MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondPage()),
        );
    Navigator.pop(context);
    🧱 Common methods:
        push()	Opens a new route (screen) and adds it to the stack
        pop()	Closes the current route and goes back
        pushReplacement()	Replaces the current route with a new one
        pushNamed() / popNamed()	Navigate using route names (defined in MaterialApp)
        canPop()	Checks if there’s a route to go back to
    📌 Tip:
        Use Navigator.pushNamed() for cleaner navigation when you have multiple screens.
        For modern navigation, consider go_router or Navigator 2.0 (Router API) for complex apps.
        Navigator works perfectly with Scaffold for building multi-screen apps.

    02:02:34 Push
        Navigator.push() is used to navigate to a new screen (route) by pushing it onto the navigation stack.
        It shows the new screen on top of the current one, allowing the user to go back later with Navigator.pop().
        Navigator.push(
            context,
            MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NextPage()),
        );
        🧱 Parameters:
            context → The current widget’s build context.
            route → The route (page/screen) to display, usually a MaterialPageRoute.
        📌 Tip:
            Use Navigator.pushNamed() if you’ve defined named routes in MaterialApp.
            Always use Navigator.pop(context) to return to the previous screen.
            Navigator.push() returns a Future that completes when the new route is popped — useful for receiving results back.

    02:02:34 Pop
        Navigator.pop() is used to close the current screen (or route) and go back to the previous one.
        It’s the reverse of Navigator.push().
        When called, it pops the top route off the navigation stack.

        Navigator.pop(context);

        🧱 Parameters:
            context → The current widget’s build context.
            result (optional) → Data you can return to the previous screen.
        📌 Tip:
            Navigator.pop() works only if a route was pushed before.
            You can return data by passing it as the second argument.
            Use it to close dialogs, modals, or bottom sheets too (not just pages).

    02:09:16 PushReplacement
        Navigator.pushReplacement() is used to navigate to a new screen while replacing the current one.
        That means the previous screen is removed from the navigation stack — the user cannot go back using the back button.
        It’s often used for navigation flows like login → home screen or splash → main app.

        Navigator.pushReplacement(
            context,
            MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NewScreen()),
        );
        🧱 Parameters:
            context → current widget’s BuildContext
            route → the route (screen) to replace with
            result (optional) → data returned to the replaced route
        📌 Tip:
            Use pushReplacement() when you don’t want users to return to the previous screen.
            For example:
            After login → home screen
            After splash → main app
            After onboarding → main content
            If you need to remove all previous routes, use:
            Navigator.pushAndRemoveUntil(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomeScreen()),
                (route) => false, // removes all previous routes
            );

    02:10:59 Send Data Through pages
        To send data through to pages - use a required named parameter as an input


👾 8. Clean UI
    02:13:18 ClipRRect
        ClipRRect is a widget that clips its child using a rounded rectangle.
        It’s commonly used to give widgets like images, containers, or cards
        rounded corners. RRect stands for “rounded rectangle”.

        ClipRRect(
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
            child: Image.asset('assets/image.png'),
        );

    🧱 Common properties:
        borderRadius → controls the roundness of the corners
        clipBehavior → defines how clipping is applied (e.g., Clip.antiAlias, Clip.hardEdge)
        child → the widget to be clipped
    📌 Tip:
        ClipRRect only clips the visible area — it doesn’t affect the layout.
        For rounded corners on Container backgrounds, you can also use BoxDecoration with borderRadius.
        Use ClipOval if you want to make a circle or ellipse shape instead.

    02:17:40 Hero
        Hero is a widget that provides a shared element transition between two routes (screens).
        When you navigate to another page, the Hero widget animates the transition of a matching
        widget smoothly between the screens.
        This is great for image previews, profile pictures, or cards that expand into detail pages.

        Hero(
            tag: 'hero-tag',
            child: Image.asset('assets/image.png'),
        );

        ⚡ Important:
            Both the source and destination Hero must have the same tag.
            The tag must be unique for each Hero pair.
        🧱 Common properties:
            tag → unique identifier to match Hero widgets between screens.
            child → the widget to animate.
            flightShuttleBuilder → optional, allows customizing the animation look.
            transitionOnUserGestures → allows transitions during back gesture (iOS).
        📌 Tip:
            Hero animations work best with images or simple widgets.
            Always use the same tag on both widgets.
            Works automatically with Navigator.push() and Navigator.pop().
            You can wrap any widget in a Hero—not just images!
        🧭 Common use cases:
            Profile avatar → profile page
            Thumbnail image → fullscreen view
            Card preview → detail screen

    02:22:14 SnackBar
        SnackBar is a lightweight message displayed at the bottom of the screen to provide
        brief feedback to the user. It can include a simple message, an action (like “UNDO”),
        and disappears automatically after a few seconds.

        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
            SnackBar(
                content: Text('This is a SnackBar!'),
            ),
        );

        🧱 Common properties:
            content → the main widget, usually a Text.
            backgroundColor → sets the background color of the snackbar.
            action → adds an optional button (e.g., “Undo”).
            duration → how long it stays visible.
            behavior → e.g., SnackBarBehavior.floating to make it float above UI.
            shape → gives rounded corners or custom shapes.
        📌 Tip:
            Always use ScaffoldMessenger.of(context) instead of the old Scaffold.of(context) (deprecated).
            SnackBar disappears automatically, but you can also dismiss it programmatically.
            Great for quick feedback like “Saved”, “Copied”, “Deleted”, etc.

    02:25:29 Alert - showDialog(), AlertDialog(), AboutDialog(), showAboutDialog()

        *** showDialog() is a built-in function used to display a modal dialog on top of the current screen.
        It blocks interaction with the rest of the app until the dialog is dismissed.
        It’s commonly used with widgets like AlertDialog or SimpleDialog.

        showDialog(
            context: context,
            builder: (BuildContext context) {
                return AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Dialog Title'),
                    content: Text('This is the content of the dialog.'),
                    actions: [
                        TextButton(
                            onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
                            child: Text('Close'),
                        ),
                    ],
                );
            },
        );

        🧱 Common parameters:
            context → required. The build context of the current widget.
            builder → returns the widget to display (e.g., AlertDialog).
            barrierDismissible → whether tapping outside closes the dialog (true by default).
            barrierColor → color behind the dialog (e.g., semi-transparent black).
            useSafeArea → ensures it doesn’t overlap system UI.
            useRootNavigator → decides which navigator to use.
        📌 Tips:
            Always use Navigator.pop(context) to close the dialog.
            Return values can be passed from the dialog to the previous screen using Navigator.pop(context, value).
            You can also use showModalBottomSheet() for bottom popups.
        🧭 Common use cases:
            Confirmation dialogs (e.g., Delete / Cancel)
            Error or success messages
            Custom forms or widgets inside a popup


        *** AlertDialog() is a material design dialog that alerts the user to a situation and provides optional
        actions (e.g., OK / Cancel). It usually contains a title, a content message, and action buttons.

        showDialog(
            context: context,
            builder: (context) {
                return AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Alert'),
                    content: Text('This is an alert message.'),
                    actions: [
                        TextButton(
                            onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
                            child: Text('Cancel'),
                        ),
                        TextButton(
                            onPressed: () {
                                // Do something
                                Navigator.pop(context);
                            },
                            child: Text('OK'),
                        ),
                    ],
                );
            },
        );

        🧱 Common properties:
            title → top of the dialog (usually Text).
            content → main message or widget.
            actions → list of buttons (e.g., TextButton).
            shape → customize the border shape.
            backgroundColor → set background color.

        *** AboutDialog() is a prebuilt dialog that displays information about the app, such as its name,
        version, icon, and legal info. It’s typically used in “About” sections of apps.

        showAboutDialog(
            context: context,
            applicationName: 'My Flutter App',
            applicationVersion: '1.0.0',
            applicationIcon: Icon(Icons.info),
            children: [
                Text('This is a simple Flutter app.'),
            ],
        );
        🧱 Common properties:
            applicationName → app’s name.
            applicationVersion → version number.
            applicationIcon → icon widget shown at the top.
            applicationLegalese → legal text (e.g., copyrights).
            children → list of extra widgets or info.

        📌 Tip:
            AlertDialog is used for actions and confirmations.
            AboutDialog is used for static info about the app.
            Both appear on top of the UI and block interaction until dismissed.
