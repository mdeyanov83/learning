🗺️ 7. Navigation
    Navigator() is a Flutter widget and class that manages a stack of routes (screens). It lets you navigate
    between pages, push new screens, and pop back to previous ones — like a web browser’s history.
    * Stack-based navigation:
        - Each screen is a route.
        - You can push (go forward) or pop (go back).

    Navigator.push(
        context,
        MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondPage()),
        );
    Navigator.pop(context);
    🧱 Common methods:
        push()	Opens a new route (screen) and adds it to the stack
        pop()	Closes the current route and goes back
        pushReplacement()	Replaces the current route with a new one
        pushNamed() / popNamed()	Navigate using route names (defined in MaterialApp)
        canPop()	Checks if there’s a route to go back to
    📌 Tip:
        Use Navigator.pushNamed() for cleaner navigation when you have multiple screens.
        For modern navigation, consider go_router or Navigator 2.0 (Router API) for complex apps.
        Navigator works perfectly with Scaffold for building multi-screen apps.

    02:02:34 Push
        Navigator.push() is used to navigate to a new screen (route) by pushing it onto the navigation stack.
        It shows the new screen on top of the current one, allowing the user to go back later with Navigator.pop().
        Navigator.push(
            context,
            MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NextPage()),
        );

    02:02:34 Pop
    02:09:16 PushReplacement
    02:10:59 Send Data Through pages
