When writing test, you must think of every possible scenario where the app or function
will work, will NOT work and may crash.

Test types
  - Unit - test the smallest portion of code - a function, method or a class.
  - Component ("Widget") - Verify that a component (which usually consists
    of multiple classes) behaves as expected.
    A component test, often requires the use of Mock Objects (objects that can
    mimic user actions, events, instance child components, etc.)
  - E2E - Integration "E2E" (End-To-End) tests - Verify the behavior of the
    entire app, or a large chunk of an app. An integration test, generally runs
    on a simulated or real device and consists of 2 pieces:
    > the app itself
    > the test app that will put the app through its paces.
