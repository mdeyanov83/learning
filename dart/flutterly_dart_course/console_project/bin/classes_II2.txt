Abstraction Checklist

* Abstract classes, Abstract methods, Interfaces
* Abstraction concept is achieved by using the 'implements' keyword
* Class A implements B{} - B is an INTERFACE that needs to be implemented in A
* In Dart, every class is an IMPLICIT INTERFACE, but every abstract class is an EXPLICIT INTERFACE
* When implementing an interface, you have to override every field and method from inside the interface
* You can extend only one class, but can IMPLEMENT one or more interfaces
