Mixins Checklist

* Mixins are used to share behavior between one or more classes
* In Dart, you can extend one single class, implement or mixin one or more classes
* The order in which you write the mixins after the 'with' keyword matters (last one wins)
* A mixin cannot be instantiated, it cannot have a constructor
* A mixin that mixes in with other class can use its methods and can even override some of them

extends (inheritance) vs implements (abstraction) vs with (mixins)
